CodeBoard
---------

A simple web app that allows a teacher to share the code 
he/she is writing on the screen in real time. For now
it uses the Ace Editor with in C++ mode. This is easy to
change.

Here is how to use it: 

1. Connect to '/teacher' and this creates a board with name 'teacher'.
2. Tell students to connect to '/teacher/view'.
3. Benefit.
